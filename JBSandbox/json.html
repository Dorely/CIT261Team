            JSON literally stands for JavaSript Object Notataion.
            This basically means that there is a specific type of syntax for typing within javascript.
            It is kind of like staying that it is Spanish verses Arabic.
            They both serve to communicate, just one is spoken differently than the other.
            Another form to write in would be XML.
            This looks a lot like HTML.
            (That is because HTML is based on XML.)

//            this is an example of NastyPath. It doesnt work correctly
//            document.write(view);

//            Here is another example of a nasty path
//            document.write(JSON.parse(view));

//            The following is also nasty path
//            var obj = JSON.parse(view);
//            document.write(obj);

//            The follwoig code is HappyPath. 
//            Although it does not display all of the values. 
//            This was copied from the internet
//            obj = JSON.parse(view);
//            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
//            obj.team[1].firstName + " " + obj.team[1].lastName;

//            for(var i = 0; i < view.length; i++){
//            obj = JSON.parse(view);
//            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
//            obj.team[i].firstName + " " + obj.team[i].lastName;
//            }


//            The following is HappyPath 
//            This set of lines displays what is in the variable called team (next two lines are debugging)
//                  console.log(obj);
//                  console.log(obj.team.length);
