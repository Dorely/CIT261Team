            JSON literally stands for JavaSript Object Notataion.
            This basically means that there is a specific type of syntax for typing within javascript.
            It is kind of like staying that it is Spanish verses Arabic.
            They both serve to communicate, just one is spoken differently than the other.
            Another form to write in would be XML.
            This looks a lot like HTML.
            (That is because HTML is based on XML.)
